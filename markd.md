• - MLX stack now local: ~/models/gpt2-mlx holds the converted GPT‑2 weights;
    mlx_lm.generate works and we spun up the CLI server on port 8080 (~/models/
    gpt2-mlx/server.log shows it listening).
  - TinyGPT repo updated with a lightweight SEAL scaffold (src/seal/*.py, configs/
    ablation_seal.yaml) plus a new editable venv in .venv.
  - Baseline training (python -m src.train …) hit the default long run and the
    shell timed out before completion—no checkpoints were produced. The process
    isn’t running anymore.

  Next steps:

  1. Redo the baseline with a smaller config or by running it directly in your
     shell so you can monitor progress (e.g., lower num_epochs, or re-run with
     python -m src.train … and let it finish).
  2. Once you have checkpoints/seal_gpt2/baseline, run python -m src.eval … to
     populate results/seal_gpt2/baseline_eval.
  3. Then kick off the SEAL sweep via python -m src.seal.run --config configs/
     ablation_seal.yaml --save_dir checkpoints/seal_gpt2/adapt --results results/
     seal_gpt2/adapt.jsonl --inner_steps 1 3 10 30 --lora_rank 4 8.

  Let me know when the baseline run is in place or if you want adjustments to make
  it faster.
